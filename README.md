# Leetcode Scrapper
<p>Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape the description of a LeetCode problem and creates a <code>README.md</code> file along side a <code>main.cpp</code> file.</p>

<p>To use the functionality of this code, fork the repository or clone it. Run the main.py file using this format:</p>
<pre>
python main.py {url}
</pre>
<p>Put in the URL to the specific problem you would like to scrape in <code>{url}</code>.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>You will need to change the <code>PATH</code> in the <code>main.py</code> file. This is where you want the folder to the LeetCode problem to be created.</p>
